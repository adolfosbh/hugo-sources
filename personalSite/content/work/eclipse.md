The main expertise I've got during my professional career is focused on [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/index.html) and
[Eclipse](https://eclipse.org) plugins development. As a result, I've done several contributions to different
open source official Eclipse projects, and promoted as committer in few of them:

* [Eclipse Orbit](https://www.eclipse.org/orbit/), main project where third party libraries are maintained as
consumable bundles for Eclipse projects.
* [Eclipse OCL](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.mdt.ocl), is an implementation of the 
[Object Constraint Language (OCL)](http://www.omg.org/spec/OCL/) standard for EMF-based models.
* [Eclipse QVTo](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.mmt.qvt-oml), a project that provides a partial implementation of the Operational Mappings Language defined by the OMG standard specification [Query/View/Transformation (QVT)](http://www.omg.org/spec/QVT/).
* [Eclipse QVTd](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.mmt.qvtd), a project that provides a partial implementation of the Core (QVTc) and Relations (QVTr) Languages defined by the OMG standard specification [Query/View/Transformation (QVT)](http://www.omg.org/spec/QVT/).
