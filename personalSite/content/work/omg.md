As you may find in their web site, "Object Management Group ([OMG](http://omg.org)) is an international, open membership, not-for-profit technology standards consortium, founded in 1989. OMG standards are driven by vendors, end-users, academic institutions and government agencies. OMG Task Forces develop enterprise integration standards for a wide range of technologies and an even wider range of industries. OMG’s modeling standards, including the Unified Modeling Language® (UML®) and Model Driven Architecture® (MDA®)".  

I've been actively part of the Revision Task Force of varied standards related to Model Driven Engineering, in particular for the Object Constraints Language ([OCL](http://www.omg.org/spec/OCL)) and Query/Views/Transformations ([QVT](http://www.omg.org/spec/QVT)) specifications.
